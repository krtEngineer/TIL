### ðŸš¨ Tech Troubleshooting: Tackling StackOverflowError in Java ðŸš¨

Today, I encountered a classic `java.lang.StackOverflowError` while working with Hibernate in a Java application. The error was triggered by recursive toString() calls within my entities.

**The Culprit?**
The `toString()` methods were trying to print entire collections, leading to an infinite loop. This is a common pitfall when dealing with bidirectional relationships in ORM-managed collections.

**The Solution:**

1. **Simplify** `toString()` **Methods**: Avoid including entire collections directly. Instead, summarize them or exclude them altogether.

2. **Lombok Annotations**: Use `@ToString.Exclude` to prevent recursion in `toString()` when using Lombok.

3. **Custom Implementation**: Manually control the `toString()` output to ensure no recursive calls.

4. **Debugging**: Add logging to trace which fields are causing the recursion.

**Example Fix:**

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Example{" +
           "id=" + id +
           ", name='" + name + '\'' +
           ", subjects=" + (subjects != null ? subjects.size() + " subjects" : "null") +
           '}';
}
```

This experience reminded me of the importance of careful design in entity relationships and the power of strategic debugging.

Happy coding ðŸ˜Ž.
